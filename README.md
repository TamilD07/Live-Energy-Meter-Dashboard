- **Export data**: Allows exporting data as CSV files with the help of `json2csv`.
- **Screenshots**: Capture the dashboard view with `html2canvas`.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for handling the build process.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for supporting modern JavaScript syntax.
- **Recharts**: A charting library for rendering energy data visually.
- **JSON2CSV**: Utility for converting JSON data to CSV for download.
- **html2canvas**: Library for generating screenshots of the dashboard.
